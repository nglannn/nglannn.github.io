  The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite  to communicate between networks and devices.

These are not subdisciplines of content strategy by any means; rather, they are business and/or design functions that all have an impact on your content product. Content strategy works to connect the dots between them.</p>
